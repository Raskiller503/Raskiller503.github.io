## Research Philosophy

I deeply believe in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the transformative potential of machine learning and deep learning applications in building energy systems. My research philosophy centers on the conviction that everything can be interconnected, creating intelligent networks that learn, adapt, and optimize building performance autonomously.

Through the integration of advanced AI algorithms with IoT infrastructure, I envision a future where buildings become self-learning entities capable of predicting, responding to, and optimizing for both energy efficiency and occupant comfort in real-time. This interconnected approach not only revolutionizes how we understand building performance but also enables unprecedented levels of automation and intelligence in sustainable architecture.
